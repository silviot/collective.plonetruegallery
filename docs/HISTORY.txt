1.0
---

* fix picasa support on Plone 4


1.0rc2
------

* made the menuitem, the settings action and tabs translatable and added
  German translations.
  [fRiSi]

* move translation files to locales folder and added script to rebuild and
  sync the po(t) files and compile mo files
  (see http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/21)
  [fRiSi]

* select the random image for subgalleries out of the subgallery's images
  fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/40
  [fRiSi]

1.0rc1
------

* Do not show "There are no images in this gallery" in case there are sub-galleries.
  [fRiSi]

* added a placeful layout for adding galleries through kupu and prettyphoto
  [espen]

* add description and text to rendered gallery page so people can have introductions to galleries
  [vangheem]

* add hide controls options for gallery portlet. closes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/28
  [vangheem]

* fixed issue where portlets wouldn't work properly when there were more than one on
  a page. Fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/27
  [vangheem]

* handle returns and quotes in descriptions. Fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/39
  [vangheem]

* gallery portlet now sets title and alt attribute of anchor tag for image.
  fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/37
  [vangheem]


0.9.1rc5
--------

* use plone.app.contentmenu.interfaces.IDisplayViewsMenu instead of plone_displayviews
  for menu declaration since it doesn't work with plone.app.contentmenu > 2.0b3
  and zope.browsermenu installed.
  [vangheem]

0.9.1rc4
--------

- import Batch directly from PloneBatch since with Zope 2.13 Batch is not
  available at the package level when plonetruegallery is loaded.
  [vangheem]


0.9.1rc3
--------

* made the basic gallery not store it's cached images since it would never be able to really
  cache them anyways. This fixes the zodb potentially growing forever on sites that use the
  gallery portlet since it needed to calculate the gallery on every new image request, which
  would cause a new write to the database. FYI, packing the database brings it back down to
  it's normal size.
  [vangheem]

0.9.1rc2
--------

  [vangheem]

* fixed fancy box not showing correctly occasionally
  [vangheem]

* restructured display type code to be a little more compatible with templating.
  It was a little messy the way it was done before so it is now slightly
  less customizable for the sake of being more compatible and modular. If any
  gallery types were defined in the old fashion, they may no longer work without
  slight modification. That is what this is now tagged as a 0.9 release.
  [vangheem]

* compatible with cmf.pt now--Chameleon.
  [vangheem]

* gallery portlet now forces the height of the image so it doesn't flicker if
  for some reason the image hasn't finished loading yet.
